# Time_Series_Forecasting
Code for time series forecasting project on aerosol optical depth (550 nm) data.

This is the code for a time series model to forecast aerosol optical depth, that I worked on during my final year b.tech project. 
For a quick and brief summary of my project you can check out the project report file **Project_Report.pdf**. And for the code and data I used, please check out **Time_Series_Forecasting** folder.

There are three folders inside **Time_Series_Forecasting**:

### 1. Scripts
Contains all the python scripts I used for the project. There are four scripts *eda_plots.py* for all the exploration stage plots, *stat_model.py* for all the statistical tests and modelling, *helper_func.py* for different data manipulation tasks and *main_script.py* contains the code that performs time series forecasting on two time series air pollution data.

### 2. Data
Contains the data I used in the project.

### 3. Plots
Cotains folders Godavari and Talcher. They contain all the important plots created during the project.
